Avoid any potential bias and ensuring that the order in which the responses were presented does not affect your judgment.\nIn the last line, order the two assistants. Please output a single line ordering Assistant 1 and Assistant 2, where '>' means 'is better than' and '=' means 'is equal to'. The order should be consistent to your comparison. If there is not comparision that one is better, it is assumed they have equivalent overall performance ('=').",
